When using document(), the functions will be added to the NAMESPACE file and load as the package is loaded. If you want to, for now, you can use the 'Depends\" field and that will load all the packages listed when this packge is loaded with library() or require()\n\n# The DESCRIPTION file also needs a lot of TLC, but figured I'd leave it as is while we work out all the other bugs",
